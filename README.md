# Data_Analysis(Super Store Analysis)

Data analysis is a process for obtaining raw data, and subsequently converting it into information useful for decision-making by users. Data is collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses, or disprove theories.

# Steps for creating a dashboard
* Step 1:
  
Collect the data for the analysis in excel format or any other convenient file.

* Step 2:

Get the file into the PowerBi Software through **Get Data**  and select the file in which the data is stored.

* Step 3:

Now Select the table we want to use and then click on the **Load Data** if we want to transform the data the click on the **Transform** button. Once we click the transform buttonn we will be redirected to Power Query Editor 

* Step 4:

 Once we click the transform buttonn we will be redirected to **Power Query Editor** here we can transform the data as we need once the transformationn is done we will close the editor and apply the changes and click on the **Load** button.

 * Step 5:

 Now we will be redirected to a dahboard designing platform. Here we need to design our dashboard according to our need. In my case I have used the **Graphs** and **Charts**  as per my needs to analze the **Profit** of a **Super Store**.

 * Step 6:

 Once the dashboard design is done we need to publish our dashboard to the **PowerBi Service**.
